For a prose description of the client/server protocol and details on how each parameter is derived, see the [API design document](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/KeyServerProtocol). For a reference client implementation, see [fxa-auth-client](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/tree/main/packages/fxa-auth-client).\n\n  ## URL Structure for Auth Server\n  All requests use URLs of the form:\n\n  > `https://<base-URI>/v1/<endpoint-path>`\n\n  Note that:\n\n  - All API access must be over a properly-validated HTTPS connection.\n  - The URL embeds a version identifier `v1`.\n    Future revisions of this API may introduce new version numbers.\n  - The base URI of the server may be configured on a per-client basis:\n    - The canonical URL for Mozilla's hosted Firefox Accounts server\n      is `https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1`.\n\n  ## Request Format\n  All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with a UTF8-encoded JSON body and must specify the content-length header. Keys and other binary data are included in the JSON as hexadecimal strings.\n\n  The following request headers may be specified to influence the behavior of the server:\n\n  - `Accept-Language` may be used to localize emails and SMS messages.\n\n  ## Response format\n  All requests receive a JSON response body with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and appropriate `Content-Length` set. The body structure depends on the endpoint returning it.\n\n  Successful responses will have an HTTP status code of 200 and a `Timestamp` header that contains the current server time in seconds since the epoch.\n\n  Error responses caused by invalid client behavior will have an HTTP status code in the 4xx range. Error responses caused by server-side problems will have an HTTP status code in the 5xx range. Failures due to invalid behavior from the client.\n\n  To simplify error handling for the client, the type of error is indicated by both\n  a defined HTTP status code and an application-specific `errno` in the body.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```js\n      {\n        \"code\": 400,  // Matches the HTTP status code\n        \"errno\": 107, // Stable application-level error number\n        \"error\": \"Bad Request\", // String description of the error type\n        \"message\": \"Invalid parameter in request body\", // Specific error message\n        \"info\": \"https://docs.dev.lcip.og/errors/1234\"  // Link to more information\n      }\n  ```\n\n  Responses for some errors may include additional parameters.\n\n\n  ### Defined errors\n\n  The currently-defined values for `code` and `errno` are:\n\n  | status code | errno | description                                                                   |\n

servers. These non-application responses can be identified by the absence of a correctly-formatted JSON response body.\n\n  Common examples include:\n\n  - `413 Request Entity Too Large`: may be returned by an upstream proxy server.\n  - `502 Gateway Timeout`: may be returned if a load-balancer can't connect to application servers.\n\n  ## Validation\n  In the documentation that follows, some properties of requests and responses are validated by common code that has been refactored and extracted. For reference, those common validations are defined here.\n\n\n  ### lib/routes/validators\n\n  - `HEX_STRING`: `/^(?:[a-fA-F0-9]{2})+$/`\n  - `BASE_36`: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`\n  - `URL_SAFE_BASE_64`: `/^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$/`\n  -
