Firefox accounts was recently renamed to Mozilla accounts.  The focus was on the front-end user experience.  We'll do our best to refer to it as Mozilla accounts in this documentation, but it's possible you'll still see some places mention Firefox Accounts or `FxA`.

**Welcome to the Ecosystem Platform docs.** The goal of this site is to serve as a documentation hub for Mozilla accounts and Subscription Platform. It provides detailed breakdowns of the various components that make up these services, including technical references, guides, concepts, deep-dives, and much more.

If you are interested in integrating with Mozilla accounts or Subscription Platform please review the **For Relying Parties** section on the left.  **Please note that currently Mozilla accounts only services clients internal to Mozilla.**
