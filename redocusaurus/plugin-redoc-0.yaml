    description: >-
      This document provides protocol-level details of the Firefox Accounts auth
      server API. For a prose description of the client/server protocol and
      details on how each parameter is derived, see the [API design
      document](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/KeyServerProtocol).
      For a reference client implementation, see
      [fxa-auth-client](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/tree/main/packages/fxa-auth-client).

        ## URL Structure for Auth Server
        All requests use URLs of the form:

        > `https://<base-URI>/v1/<endpoint-path>`

        Note that:

        - All API access must be over a properly-validated HTTPS connection.
        - The URL embeds a version identifier `v1`.
          Future revisions of this API may introduce new version numbers.
        - The base URI of the server may be configured on a per-client basis:
          - The canonical URL for Mozilla's hosted Firefox Accounts server
            is `https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1`.

        ## Request Format
        All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with a UTF8-encoded JSON body and must specify the content-length header. Keys and other binary data are included in the JSON as hexadecimal strings.

        The following request headers may be specified to influence the behavior of the server:

        - `Accept-Language` may be used to localize emails and SMS messages.

        ## Response format
        All requests receive a JSON response body with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and appropriate `Content-Length` set. The body structure depends on the endpoint returning it.

        Successful responses will have an HTTP status code of 200 and a `Timestamp` header that contains the current server time in seconds since the epoch.

        Error responses caused by invalid client behavior will have an HTTP status code in the 4xx range. Error responses caused by server-side problems will have an HTTP status code in the 5xx range. Failures due to invalid behavior from the client.

        To simplify error handling for the client, the type of error is indicated by both
        a defined HTTP status code and an application-specific `errno` in the body.

        For example:

        ```js
            {
              "code": 400,  // Matches the HTTP status code
              "errno": 107, // Stable application-level error number
              "error": "Bad Request", // String description of the error type
              "message": "Invalid parameter in request body", // Specific error message
              "info": "https://docs.dev.lcip.og/errors/1234"  // Link to more information
            }
        ```

        Responses for some errors may include additional parameters.


        ### Defined errors

        The currently-defined values for `code` and `errno` are:

        ### Responses from intermediary servers

        As with any HTTP-based API, clients must handle standard errors that may be returned by proxies, load-balancers or other intermediary servers. These non-application responses can be identified by the absence of a correctly-formatted JSON response body.

        Common examples include:

        - `413 Request Entity Too Large`: may be returned by an upstream proxy server.
        - `502 Gateway Timeout`: may be returned if a load-balancer can't connect to application servers.

        ## Validation
        In the documentation that follows, some properties of requests and responses are validated by common code that has been refactored and extracted. For reference, those common validations are defined here.

        ## Back-off protocol

        During periods of heavy load, the server may request that clients enter a "back-off" state,
        in which they avoid making further requests.

        At such times,
        it will return a `503 Service Unavailable` response
        with a `Retry-After` header denoting the number of seconds to wait
        before issuing any further requests.
        It will also include `errno: 201`
        and a `retryAfter` field
        matching the value of the `Retry-After` header
        in the body.

        For example,
        the following response indicates that the client
        should suspend making further requests
        for 30 seconds:

        ```js
            HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
            Retry-After: 30
            Content-Type: application/json

            {
                "code": 503,
                "errno": 201,
                "error": "Service Unavailable",
                "message": "Service unavailable",
                "info": "https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/api#section/Response-format",
                "retryAfter": 30,
                "retryAfterLocalized": "in a few seconds"
            }
      ```

      Note that:

      - All API access must be over HTTPS

      - The URL embeds a version identifier "v1"; future versions of this API
      may introduce new version numbers.

      - The base URL of the server may be configured on a per-client basis.


      ## Errors

      Invalid requests will return 4XX responses. Internal failures will return
      5XX. Both will include JSON responses describing the error.


      **Example error:**


      ```js
          {
            "code": 400, // matches the HTTP status code
            "errno": 101, // stable application-level error number
            "error": "Bad Request", // string description of error type
            "message": "Unknown client"
          }
      ```


      The currently-defined error responses are:

        🔒 Authenticated with session token


        Returns an array listing all the clients connected to the authenticated
        user's account, including devices, OAuth clients, and web sessions.


        This endpoint is primarily designed to power the "devices and apps" view
        on the user's account settings page. Depending on the type of client, it
        will have at least one and possibly several of the following properties:


        - `clientId`: The OAuth client_id of the connected application.

        - `sessionTokenId`: The id of the `sessionToken` held by that client, if
        any.

        - `refreshTokenId`: The id of the OAuth `refreshToken` held by that
        client, if any.

        - `deviceId`: The id of the client's device record, if it has registered
        one.


        These identifiers can be passed to
        [/account/attached_client/destroy](#tag/Devices-and-Sessions/operation/getAccountAttached_clients)
        in order to disconnect the client.


        This endpoint returns a maximum 500 last used devices and sessions.

        🔒 Authenticated with key fetch token


        Get the base-16 bundle of encrypted `kA|wrapKb`. The return value must
        be decrypted with a key derived from `keyFetchToken`, then `wrapKb` must
        be further decrypted with a key derived from the user's password.


        Since `keyFetchToken` is single-use, this can only be done once per
        session. Note that `keyFetchToken` is consumed regardless of whether the
        request succeeds or fails.


        This request will fail unless the account's email address and current
        session has been verified.

        🔒 Authenticated with session token


        Returns the 'verified' status for the account's recovery email address.


        Currently, each account is associated with exactly one email address.
        This address must be verified before the account can be used
        (specifically, `POST /certificate/sign` and `GET /account/keys` will
        return errors until the address is verified). In the future, this may be
        expanded to include multiple addresses, and/or alternate types of
        recovery methods (e.g. SMS). A new API will be provided for this extra
        functionality.


        This call is used to determine the current state (verified or
        unverified) of the account. During account creation, until the address
        is verified, the agent can poll this method to discover when it should
        proceed with `POST /certificate/sign` and `GET /account/keys`.

            A valid 200 response will be a JSON array.


            For clients that use refresh tokens, each refresh token is taken to
            represent a separate instance of that client and is returned as a
            separate entry in the list, with the `refresh_token_id` field
            distinguishing each.


            For clients that only use access tokens, all active access tokens
            are combined into a single entry in the list, and the
            `refresh_token_id` field will not be present.

        registration](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/main/packages/fxa-auth-server/docs/device_registration.md)
        record associated with the auth token used for this request. At least
        one of `name`, `type`, `pushCallback` or the tuple `{ pushCallback,
        pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey }` must be present. Beware that if you
        provide `pushCallback` without the pair `{ pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey
        }`, both of those keys will be reset to the empty string.


        `pushEndpointExpired` will be reset to false on update if the tuple `{
        pushCallback, pushPublicKey, pushAuthKey }` is specified.


        Devices should register with this endpoint before attempting to access
        the user's sync data, so that an appropriate device name can be made
        available to other connected devices.

        🔒 Authenticated with session token


        Sign a BrowserID public key. The server is given a public key and
        returns a signed certificate using the same JWT-like mechanism as a
        BrowserID primary IdP would (see
        [browserid-certifier](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid-certifier)
        for details). The signed certificate includes a `principal.email`
        property to indicate the Firefox Account identifier (a UUID at the
        account server's primary domain) and is stamped with an expiry time
        based on the `duration` parameter.


        This request will fail unless the primary email address for the account
        has been verified.


        Clients should include a query parameter, `service`, for metrics and
        validation purposes. The value of `service` should be `sync` when
        connecting to Firefox Sync or the OAuth `client_id` when connecting to
        an OAuth relier.


        If you do not specify a `service parameter`, or if you specify
        `service=sync`, this endpoint assumes the request is from a legacy Sync
        client. If the session token doesn't have a corresponding device record,
        one will be created automatically by the server.


        The signed certificate includes these additional claims:

          - `fxa-generation`: A number that increases each time the user's password is changed.
          - `fxa-keysChangedAt`: A timestamp that increases each time the user's encryption key is changed.
          - `fxa-profileChangedAt`: A timestamp that increases each time the user's core profile data is changed.
          - `fxa-lastAuthAt`: Authentication time for this session, in seconds since epoch.
          - `fxa-verifiedEmail`: The user's verified recovery email address.
          - `fxa-tokenVerified`: A boolean indicating whether the user's login was verified using an email confirmation or 2FA in addition to their password.
          - `fxa-amr`: A list of strings giving the ways in which the user was authenticated. Possible values include:
            - `pwd`: the user provided the account password
            - `email`: the user completed an email confirmation loop
            - `otp`: the user completed a 2FA challenge
          - `fxa-aal`: An integer giving the authenticator assurance level at which the user was authenticated - that is, the number of independent auth factors that they provided during login.

        Authorize a new OAuth client connection to the user's account, returning
        a short-lived authentication code that the client can exchange for
        access tokens at the OAuth token endpoint.


        This route behaves like the oauth-server /authorization endpoint except
        that it is authenticated directly with a sessionToken rather than with a
        BrowserID assertion.

        🔒🔓 Optionally authenticated with session token


        Grant new OAuth tokens for use by a connected client, using one of the
        following grant types:
          - `grant_type=authorization_code`: A single-use code obtained via OAuth redirect flow.
          - `grant_type=refresh_token`: A refresh token issued by a previous call to this endpoint.
          - `grant_type=fxa-credentials`: Directly grant tokens using an FxA sessionToken.

        This is the "token endpoint" as defined in RFC6749, and behaves like the
        [oauth-server /token
        endpoint](#tag/OAuth-Server-API-Overview/operation/postToken) except
        that the `fxa-credentials` grant can be authenticated directly with a
        sessionToken rather than with a BrowserID assertion.

        Re-sends a verification code to the account's recovery email address.
        The code is first sent when the account is created, but if the user
        thinks the message was lost or accidentally deleted, they can request a
        new message to be sent via this endpoint. The new message will contain
        the same code as the original message. When this code is provided to
        `/v1/recovery_email/verify_code`, the email will be marked as
        'verified'.


        This endpoint may send a verification email to the user. Callers may
        optionally provide the `service` parameter to indicate what
        identity-attached service they're acting on behalf of. This is an opaque
        alphanumeric token that will be embedded in the verification link as a
        query parameter.

        🔒 Authenticated with password forgot token


        Resends the email from `POST /password/forgot/send_code`, for use when
        the original email has been lost or accidentally deleted.


        This endpoint requires the `passwordForgotToken` returned in the
        original response, so only the original client which started the process
        may request a resent message. The response will match that from `POST
        /password/forgot/send_code`, except `ttl` will be lower to indicate the
        shorter validity period. `tries` will also be lower if `POST
        /password/forgot/verify_code` has been called.

      description: >-
        Requests a 'reset password' code to be sent to the user's recovery
        email. The user should type this code into the agent, which will then
        submit it to `POST /password/forgot/verify_code`.


        The code will be either 8 or 16 digits long, with the length indicated
        in the response. The email will either contain the code itself or the
        URL for a web page that displays the code.


        The response includes `passwordForgotToken`, which must be submitted
        with the code to `POST /password/forgot/verify_code`.


        The response also specifies the TTL of `passwordForgotToken` and an
        upper limit on the number of times the token may be submitted. By
        limiting the number of submission attempts, we also limit an attacker's
        ability to guess the code. After the token expires, or the maximum
        number of submissions has been made, the agent must call this endpoint
        again to generate a new code and token pair.


        Each account can have at most one `passwordForgotToken` valid at a time.
        Calling this endpoint causes existing tokens to be invalidated and a new
        one created. Each token is associated with a specific code, so by
        extension the codes are invalidated with their tokens.
