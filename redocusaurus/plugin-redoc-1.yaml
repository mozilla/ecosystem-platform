    # Overview


    ## Request Format

    None of the requests are authenticated. The customs server is an internal
    service that is running on the same machine as the service that uses it
    (currently only the auth server) and is listening on localhost.


    ## Response Format

    All successful requests will produce a response with HTTP status code of
    "200" and content-type of "application/json". The structure of the response
    body will depend on the endpoint in question.


    Failures due to invalid behavior from the client will produce a response
    with HTTP status code of "400" and content-type of "application/json".
    Failures due to an unexpected situation on the server will produce a
    response with HTTP status code of "500" and content-type of
    "application/json".
